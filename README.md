ZTM - Course project </br>
A splash page designed in Figma is a visually striking introductory screen that appears when users first visit a website or app. It typically features eye-catching graphics, a 
compelling headline, and a call-to-action (CTA) button that encourages users to proceed further. Figmaâ€™s collaborative design tools make it easy to create a polished layout 
with interactive elements, ensuring a seamless user experience and consistent branding across devices. With Figma, the splash page can be easily prototyped, tested, and refined 
in real-time with team members.
